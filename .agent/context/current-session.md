## For AI Assistants
When asking AI assistants questions, reference this session context and mention which skill file is relevant. Example:
"Use version-safety skill to create a new file for UI changes"
"Use file-manager to deploy V8_3 to both locations"
"Use context-transfer to generate a handoff prompt for new session"
