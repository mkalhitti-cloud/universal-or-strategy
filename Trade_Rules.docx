Trend Trade

**The Trend Trade: **This is the trade we will make most of our money
on. With the trend trade we are looking to make multiple points on the
trade.

A trend trade is when a stock is going in one direction (either up or
down) for an extended period of time. We are looking to get in on the
direction of the trend.

When the stock is trending down, we short it when the criteria are met.
When the stock is trending up, we want to buy it when the criteria are
met.

The trend trade will commonly look like a ski slope.

With the trend trade we will use the 9 EMA and 15 EMA. These are the
only times that these EMA's will be used.

We will get into trend trades at the 9 EMA and 15 EMA, given that the 9
EMA and 15 EMA are not too far apart refer to Order Management
Spreadsheet

We will enter into the trend trade with 1/3 of our position at the 9 EMA
and 2/3 of our position at the 15 EMA.

**Rule #1: **There is no such thing as a trend trade before 9:45am.

**Rule #2/3: **We do not enter trend trades during lunch (around noon)
or after 3pm.

**What happens if only 1/3 of our order is filled?**

If we get in with only 1/3 of the position, we will stay in the trade
all day or until the trend breaks.

**What do I do when my full order is filled?**

Take first profit according to Order Management
Spreadsheet


Trail the remaining contracts for the rest of the day or until the trend
breaks (See Bracket Order Lesson). You may also look to lock in profits
if you see support or resistance opposing the trend.

**How do you know when a trend is broken?**

A trend is broken when the price breaks the 15 EMA according to our stop
order see Order Management
Spreadsheet
Do not be afraid to lock in profits, especially if there is support or
resistance that pushes against the trend

We are able to get into trend trades more than one time if the trend
continues through the day

Regular Moving Average Trade

**The Regular Moving Average Trade: **With a regular moving average
trade we need the price to move significantly to hit one of the
following indicators: the 30 EMA, 65 EMA, 200 EMA, pivot points and
VWAP. We are not using the 9 EMA or the 15 EMA.

See Order Management Spreadsheet for more detailed information on
entries, exits, and stop orders



We recommend /ES (or /MES) for beginning traders

Once we have our first profit, always raise your stop to lock in profit

The faster something moves to a level, the better

We will only try our entries on a level [ONE TIME] (unless a
significant amount of time has passed, or there has been a significant
move to get back there)

If two levels are close to one another, go with the more conservative
level

**[Follow the Rules]{.underline}**

We [only]{.underline} make trades when our levels are hit

If two levels are close to one another, always use the [more
conservative level]{.underline}

[Be wary]{.underline} of trading during news events

Sometimes we may need to look at a [longer timeframe]{.underline} to
find support or resistance levels that fit our criteria.

Just because we have a level somewhere [does not]{.underline} mean that
there is always a trade to be made- [the setup must always fit a certain
trade]{.underline}.

Far From Moving Average Trades

**Far From Moving Average Trade: **A far from moving average trade is
when the instrument moves far away from our moving averages and becomes
overbought or oversold. We are looking to take advantage of the
pullback.

With a far from moving average trade we always start by looking at
the [5 minute chart]{.underline}. Once we find an instrument that fits
the criteria we will switch over to the [1 minute chart]{.underline}. As
soon as the price begins to move back up toward the moving average we
will place a *[Market Order]{.underline}*.

**Rule #1: **We need the instrument to move significantly away from the
moving average lines see the Order Management
Spreadsheet

**Rule #2: **We need the RSI (Relative Strength Index) to be above 80
(overbought), or below 20 (oversold).

See Order Management Spreadsheet for more detailed information on
entries, exits, and stop orders.

**[Notes:]{.underline}**

A FFMA Trade is the [ONLY]{.underline} trade we look to make during news

We may not be able to enter this trade every time it sets up, you must
be fast and decisive

This trade will either work very quickly, or not at all

If the RSI remains above 80 or below 20 for an extended period of time
this may not be as effective

With this, or any of our trades, it is okay to start with the /MES until
you are more comfortable

Double Tops and Double Bottoms

**Double Top: **A double top is when the instrument reaches a high for
the day, goes down, and then retests the high a second time.

**﻿Double Bottom: **A double bottom is when the instrument reaches a low
for the day, goes up, and then retests the low a second time.

**Rule #1: **The instrument must move away from the high or
low [significantly]{.underline} see Order Management
Spreadsheet

**Rule #2: **We need [at least 30 minutes]{.underline} between the first
high/low and the second high/low

**Rule #3: **There is [NO SUCH THING]{.underline} as a triple top/bottom

The Momentum Trade

**The Momentum Trade: **The Momentum Trade is when an instrument has
gone sideways for a long period of time, hitting one of our levels
several times, and then breaks out and makes a move. Typically the
market will all join in on the direction it breaks into.

**Rule #1: **On the 5 minute chart, it needs to go sideways for at least
30 minutes. We always use the 5 minute chart for the momentum trade.

**Rule #2: **We can't have the sideways movement be too wide. Refer to
the Order Management Spreadsheet for point ranges.
