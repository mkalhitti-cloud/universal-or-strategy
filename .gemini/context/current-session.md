**Date:** January 11, 2025
**Version:** V5.3.1
**Status:** Skills setup - Gemini context infrastructure

## What We Just Did
- Created `.gemini/` folder structure
- Migrated and optimized critical skills from `.claude`
- Set up `GEMINI.md` and `README.md`
- Confirmed V5.3.1 stability

## Current Working Directory
Your NinjaTrader strategies folder:
`C:\Users\Mohammed Khalid\OneDrive\Desktop\WSGTA\Github\universal-or-strategy\`

## Latest Test Results
- V5.3.1 live price tracking: ✅ Tested and working
- RMA click-entry calibration: ✅ Accurate within 1-2 ticks
- Memory usage: ⚠️ 80%+ on test system (optimization ongoing)

## Next Steps
1. Add remaining skill files as needed.
2. When testing Fibonacci confluence, create `references/fibonacci-guide.md`.
3. Keep this file updated with session progress.

## Immediate Priorities
1. ✅ Live price tracking verified
2. ✅ RMA click-entry working
3. 🔄 Fibonacci confluence development
4. 🔄 Memory optimization (aim for < 70%)
5. 🔄 Additional WSGTA strategies

## Important Notes
- Order_Management.xlsx is single source of truth
- Always reference live-price-tracking.md before any price change code
- Keep backups before major changes
- Test on Rithmic feed with Apex account
